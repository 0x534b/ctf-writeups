# Challenge Description
PMP was walking by earlier, muttering something about “stars”.
I think he’s said something about it before.
I also want to know: do stars spin? I’d search for it, but i’m too busy.
I think he’s mentioned something about stars somewhere...help me out?

The first thing i did was checking on the HSCTF discord for someone called PMP and found this message.

As PMP said: Time to ask reddit!
I searched for “dostarsevenspin reddit” and found this profile.

At this point i knew that all of his posts were deleted because someone hacked his profile, so i needed to find a cached version of the profile before the hack.
I decided to try on [waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/) and searched for the page.

Looks like there is a saved version of the profile from May 27, 2020.
I opened the link to the old version and found all the deleted post, including the one with the flag.
